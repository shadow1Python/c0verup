**BEFORE READING ANY FURTHER: I AM LOOKING FOR AN IOS 13 DEVICE TO TEST AN EXPIEREMENTAL VERSION OF MY THE APP (With ios 13 and 14 support) # c0verup**

This is very expierimental and will predominantly be exploit implimentation on top of pre-exisitng jailbreaks (A UI will be done in the future)


**NOTES:**

This will not be compiled (Unless you want to compile it) by me (publically) until release.

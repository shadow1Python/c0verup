**NOTES:**

*Alpha and beta are two different release sections, and will include two different versions of c0verup (Both will be similar with slight changes) release V1.0 will be the first official working release of c0verup and will use either Alpha or Beta (Depending on a mix of factors like; What I feel the best version is, and which one has the most downloads in it's latest release)*

*Alpha and beta are **NOT** official releases, they **ARE** pre-releases, anything in them is not official and there will be quite a few... bugs and mishaps to say the least*

*I am one person, developing an entire jailbreak "Oh bUt uR uSiNg oPen sOuRcE proJecTs" yes, but the majority of the stuff you find here has been changed... A lot, the only thing that won't change for quite some time is using Odyssey's IPA, it can't be changed until I get my own IPA to work, that being said...*

*I am looking for developers, I currently don't have the funds to pay you, so I understand not wanting to work, and I'm not even asking you to work... I'm just saying that if you have a little time out of your day you can write some code in either Javascript or HTML that would be good for our project, I'd appreciate it and of course credit you.*

*I will however, pay an IOS developer to create a working IPA that's a remake of Odyssey but c0verup themed (Email me for more info)*

*I will also, pay anyone with a macintosh (Has to be able to run configurator and xcode) to let me anydesk and work on my project, thank you.*

**ALPHA OR BETA:**

*Currently Alpha is my main focus, and my favorite is probably beta... I'll update this part over time while I list some differences below*

*Alpha is an unc0ver themed website with dark and light mode with a well fitting logo, mockup, and installation method.*

*Beta is an odyssey themed website with a better credit layout and installation guide, as well as a stunning top banner and genious description. With a unique mockup that you must see.*

*Alpha is the c0verup.dev folder*

*Beta is the c0verup-odyssey folder*
